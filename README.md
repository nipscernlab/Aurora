# AURORA  

**AURORA** was a powerful and modern **Windows-only IDE**, fully developed using **Electron**, created to support the **SAPHO** hardware development ecosystem.

The IDE provided tight integration with the SAPHO toolchain, enabling users to:

- Program custom processors using the **CMM language**
- Compile designs through SAPHO compilers
- Run hardware simulations using **Icarus Verilog**
- Visualize signal waveforms via **GTKWave**
- Inspect processor structure using the **PRISM RTL Viewer**

AURORA was designed as an **end-to-end development environment**, unifying code editing, compilation, simulation, and visualization into a single workflow.

Although no longer the primary interface, AURORA played a key role in the evolution of the SAPHO ecosystem, laying the groundwork for more advanced and modular development tools such as **POLARIS**.
